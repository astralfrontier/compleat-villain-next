The Negamarmot is the pet of some multiversal conqueror defeated in the past by the world’s superheroes. Unfortunately it got away, and shows up unexpectedly from time to time.

There’s two problems. The Negamarmot will eat anything. Anything. And it will vomit up anything, from anywhere. Scientists theorize that as a partially negative-matter being, it has a two way wormhole in its gullet.

Its only motives are to examine interesting things - and it can change size radically to do so - and to eat or vomit up random things at intervals.

Apparently it derives sustenance from things moving through the wormhole interface.
