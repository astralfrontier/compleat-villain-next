Mercenary supervillain Jacques Rabbit stole a batch of super-soldier serum. He left the most useless vial behind, in teenage delivery driver Robbie Rhodes’ beat-up car. Robbie kept it hidden, along with the notes from the lab on what it included. The moment where a supervillain had come into an otherwise boring life was exciting beyond description. And when it was over… That boredom and craving for excitement drove Robbie to drink the serum - and change.

The combination of galago, axolotl, and wrasse DNA did more than give Robbie the ability to turn into a furry human-galago hybrid with amazing reflexes. It means that Robbie can switch between male and female bodies. And worse, the unstable nature of the serum means that sometimes, Robbie will switch whether he/she wants to or not.

Robbie consults with the school’s chemistry teacher, Dr. Emilio Blasto, for help in controlling the transformations, and for ideas on what to do with this power. He/she fears that Jacques Rabbit may learn about the use of the serum and come for the Rhodes family. But mostly, Robbie is overjoyed that life can be so much fun now.

Note: Robbie has embraced his/her shifts and goes by appropriate pronouns when in an appropriate form.

# Drives

- Outmaneuver an enemy with grace and style
- Calm endangered civilians by being a furry friend
- Impress or charm a teammate

# Moves

- Do cool bouncy acrobatic hero stuff!
- Use hyper-enhanced galago senses and agility
- Transform at an inopportune moment

# Variations

## The Shifts

- The super-soldier serum Robbie used turns the user into a human-animal hybrid, with the best qualities of the animal DNA. For Robbie, that includes an occasional sex shift. If that’s too much for the story, give Robbie an assigned gender and remove it.
- You can also introduce other animal DNA, perhaps giving Robbie an option to shift into more than just a human-galago form, perhaps with other strengths (and weaknesses).

## The Theft

- Robbie worries that Jacques Rabbit might come hunting for him/her. Would that happen? Maybe - if the mercenary made a mistake by losing the serum. Or maybe the fear is all in Robbie’s imagination.
- Maybe it wasn’t an accident. Dr. Emilio Blasto, the school’s chemist, has been very helpful in assisting Robbie…

## Personal Life

- Who knows that Robbie can shift sex? How does Robbie present at his/her school? Is it the same school he/she used to attend?
- Does Robbie have a favorite or preferred form? We haven’t stated what Robbie was before the serum - because it might not matter now, or because one version or another works better for a given story.

# Associations

- Robbie is receiving help from his/her high school chemist, Dr. Blasto.
- Robbie worries that mercenary villain Jacques Rabbit, himself a recipient of the super-solder serum, may return.
