Lewis Carter was visiting an experimental observatory that used a giant gravitational lens to pull in radiation from space and study it up close. It caught a cosmic beam that a dying civilization had used to encode their civilization’s collective wisdom, hoping someone else in the universe would remember them. The whole of it engraved itself on Lewis’s brain.

He started babbling, and tore apart a vital device in the observatory just to build a tool to help explain himself. The scientists there were impressed - and terrified. Later, Lewis would exhibit not only astounding knowledge, but also raw blasts of cosmic radiation. The scientists studying him resorted to the unthinkable - they asked Professor Pulsar, a reformed supervillain and master of cosmic physics, to take care of the young man.

Lewis has taken up the mantle of superhero under the name “Archive”. If everyone around him is going to be in danger anyway, they may as well be prepared for it. And there’s a fire in his head that pulses like the heartbeat of a star. If he doesn’t use this knowledge, doesn’t do something with it, doesn’t stay active, he feels like it’s going to burn its way out of his skull. Even if he does, he worries it just might do that anyway.

# Drives

- Try out a new gadget
- Put obscure interstellar knowledge to use
- Achieve control over your own powers

# Moves

- Use dynamatter to form armor, weapons, and gadgets
- Create a specialized high-tech solution in seconds
- Go into physical or mental overload from the pressure

# Variations

## Health

- The cosmic radiation that struck Lewis may be more or less harmful than feared. It may threaten Lewis’ life, forcing him to choose between the power and his lifespan - or it may be a hazard to those around him, forcing him into isolation.
- The cosmic burst may have had other effects besides knowledge. For example, it might somehow transform Lewis into a member of the alien species.

## Tragedy and Hope

- Will Lewis’s use of the alien knowledge and technology lead to a repeat of whatever disaster doomed the aliens?
- Conversely, could the aliens be brought back somehow? Or are some still alive, perhaps as fellow heroes, villains, or travelers?

## Jealousy and Danger

- Who wants to use Lewis’ inventions? Who won’t ask permission?
- Lewis already struggles to control his own powers and his own mind. The aliens’ knowledge didn’t include humans, and may not account for their needs. What if what he makes is inherently dangerous? Will he do it anyway, for the knowledge to have an outlet?

# Associations

- Archive’s mentor is Professor Pulsar, an ex-supervillain
- Archive may have other contacts in the scientific community
